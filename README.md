# Fuse Character File Editor Project

## Overview

This project is in the early stages of development and aims to create a Unity-based editor for Fuse character files. The primary goal is to enable developers and artists to easily modify character attributes, such as age and skin color, within these proprietary binary files.

## Project Goals and Roadmap

### Understanding the File Format
- Analyze the binary structure of Fuse character files.
- Identify key data fields like age and skin color and their encoding within the file.

### Developing the Editor
- Implement a reader to interpret and display the data from the files.
- Design a user-friendly interface in Unity for inputting changes.
- Develop functionality to safely write modifications back into the file.

### Testing and Refinement
- Test the editor with various Fuse character files.
- Refine the interface and functionality based on user feedback.

## Current Progress
- Initial analysis of the Fuse file format is underway.
- Planning the basic architecture of the Unity editor.

## How to Contribute
- Suggestions on interpreting the file format are welcome.
- Ideas for UI design and user experience considerations are much appreciated.
- Once the initial version is up, feedback on usability and functionality will be crucial.

## Planned Features
- Easy-to-use interface for editing character attributes.
- Real-time previews of changes.
- Compatibility with various versions of Fuse character files.

## Get Involved!
This project is open to contributions. If you're interested in helping to build this tool, please feel free to reach out, fork the repository, or submit pull requests with your proposed changes.
